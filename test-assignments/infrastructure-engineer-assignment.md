### Infrastructure Engineer Test Assignment

Your task is to create a request caching solution by implementing an Nginx module in Lua, 
without using the built-in request cache of Nginx. It should only work for GET requests. Use Redis as storage.

#### Extras

- An ideal solution would have a few basic tests to cover the functionality. 
- We love to see things in action, so ideally we could spin up and start the whole thing with docker-compose.

#### Hints

- You can use http://httpstat.us/ as a fake API
- You can use OpenResty if you want

---

The goal of the assignment is to

- prove that you understand the main concepts of how the web works and what containerization is 
- and see how you write code in a language you're potentially unfamiliar with.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 5 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions. If we like your code overall, we'll discuss the solution in person too so you'll get a chance to tell us what else you wanted to add and how you planned to implement those.

Feel free to ask questions to clarify the details.

Submit your code through `bitbucket.org` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `developer-account@recart.com` email address.
