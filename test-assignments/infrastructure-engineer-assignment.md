# Recart 

### Infrastructure Engineer Test Assignment

Your task is to create a request caching solution by implementing an Nginx module in Lua, 
without using the built-in request cache of Nginx. Use Redis as storage.

An ideal solution would have a few basic tests to cover the functionality. 

We also love to see things in action, so ideally we could spin up and start the whole thing with docker-compose.

---

The goal of the assignment is to

- prove that you understand the main concepts of how the web works and what containerization is 
- and see how you write code in a language you're potentially unfamiliar with.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 5 hours on this. 
We'll discuss your solution in person so you'll get a chance to tell us what else you wanted to add and how you planned to implement those.

Feel free to ask questions to clarify the business need and the details.

Submit your your code through `bitbucket.org` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `recart` user.
